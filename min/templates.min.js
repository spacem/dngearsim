If you want to see the full calculations in the code these are in statService.js<pre>eqhp = ( (hp / (1-pdef%)) + (hp / (1-mdef%)) ) / 2</pre>eqhp is equivalent hp. This is essentially the amount of damage you will take before you die. It takes both hp and defence into acount. There is magic and phisical defence so I work out both magic and physical eqhp and show the average.</p><h4>Some skills do not work correctly?</h4><p>I have implemented many skills now however there numerous classes I do not play. Feel free to get in touch if you want to work with me to implement any extra skill for your class.</p><h4>What is with all these items that do not exist in-game?</h4><p>I show everything I can from the data files. Some items may not exist also some items have duplicates but it is useful to see what might be coming.</p><h4>How is the data stored?</h4><p>Only published builds are saved to the server. Other builds may be lost if your browser is reset. If you want to keep any builds without logging in you can export them as json files that can be shared and imported into another browser. When you log in your log in to publish your build your details are sent directly from your browser to google firebase for authentication.</p><h4>Growth spirits cannot be enhanced?</h4><p>Stats for this are random so please create a custom item with the stats you get.</p><h4>Why are the calcuations not accurate?</h4><p>I believe they are - or at least out only by a tiny bit. If your stats are marginally different most likely you are missing some item or passive skill, etc. Feel free to ask if things do not look right. If you publish your build I can have a look to see if there is a glitch that needs fixing.</p><h3>advanced</h3><p>For advanced configuration settings use <a ng-href="setup">&raquo;this link</a></p></div><div class="col-sm-4 hidden-xs"><img src="images/tink.png"></div></div>');}]);
